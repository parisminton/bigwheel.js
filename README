bigwheel.js is my library of JavaScript functions for basic browser stuff like cross-compatibility, working with styles dynamically and helping with rollovers and effects.

I'd keep modifying functions I'd written earlier for different purposes, andtook the notion to make them easier to reuse and collect them somewhere. As I'm building my portfolio, now's a great time to do it.

With all the great libraries out there, why build my own? For the learning experience, the challenge, the chance to expose my code to the community, and because it's fun.
