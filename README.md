bigwheel.js
===========

**bigwheel.js** is my library of JavaScript functions for tasks I do over and over again, like event handling and string manipulation.

It irks me that I use so many libraries. On personal projects with no deadline, it's satisfying to build stuff with my bare hands out of vanilla JavaScript.
