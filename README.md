bigwheel.js
===========

**bigwheel.js** is my JavaScript library for tasks I do over and over again, like selecting elements, event handling and string manipulation. It's my take on [jQuery][1], made up of only the functions I actually use.

It irks me that I use so many libraries. On personal projects with no deadline, it's satisfying and instructive to build stuff with my bare hands out of vanilla JavaScript.

Here's the [wiki][2] and [changelog][3].
